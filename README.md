# Pokemon Task Manager

This is a task management application where tasks are uniquely assigned to Pokémon characters. Users can create, view, and delete tasks associated with different Pokémon. This application is designed for desktop users and leverages a Pokémon API to fetch Pokémon names.
I had to do it for a take-home test for a job.
